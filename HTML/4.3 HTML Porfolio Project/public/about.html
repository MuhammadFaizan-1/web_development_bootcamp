<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi, I’m Faizan 👋</h2>
<p>
  I’m a curious, creative, and ambitious learner who enjoys exploring new
  skills, building projects, and challenging myself to grow every day.
  Currently, I’m pursuing my studies in Computer Science with a focus on
  full-stack web development, and I’m passionate about using technology to solve
  real-world problems.
</p>
<p>
  What excites me most is how ideas can be turned into something
  meaningful—whether it’s designing a sleek website, creating interactive
  applications, or collaborating on innovative solutions. I believe every
  project is not just about coding, but about storytelling, creativity, and
  making an impact.
</p>
<h3>Beyond academics, I enjoy:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>💻 Experimenting with new coding languages and frameworks</li>
  <li>📚 Reading books and learning about different cultures</li>
  <li>🎶 Listening to music and sometimes trying out a few tunes myself</li>
  <li>🌍 Dreaming about traveling to new places and meeting diverse people</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I see myself as someone who’s always growing—open to feedback, eager to learn,
  and unafraid to step out of my comfort zone. My goal is to combine creativity
  with technology to build solutions that matter, and eventually contribute to
  the global tech community.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re reading this, you now know a little more about me—but the journey is
  just getting started, and I’m excited to see where it takes me. 🚀
